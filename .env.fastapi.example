# FastAPI Configuration for Laravel BookRecSys Admin

# Add this line to your .env file to configure the FastAPI base URL:
FASTAPI_URL=https://21fd-34-27-50-17.ngrok-free.app

# Replace the URL above with your actual FastAPI base URL (without endpoint path).
# The application will automatically append the correct endpoints:
# - For recommendations: /recommend
# - For training: /sync/train
# Examples:
# FASTAPI_URL=https://your-fastapi-server.com
# FASTAPI_URL=http://localhost:8001
# FASTAPI_URL=https://abcd1234.ngrok-free.app

# Required FastAPI endpoint:
# - POST /sync/train (for training with CSV file)
#
# Optional endpoints (not required but helpful):
# - GET /health (for basic health checks)
# - GET / (root endpoint for basic connectivity)

# The admin system will test connectivity by making a GET request to your
# training endpoint. Different response codes mean:
# - 200: Perfect, endpoint working
# - 405 (Method Not Allowed): Good, endpoint exists (normal for GET on POST endpoint)
# - 422 (Unprocessable Entity): Good, endpoint ready for data
# - 404 (Not Found): Server exists but endpoint missing
# - Connection errors: Server unreachable

# Troubleshooting:
# 1. If you get timeout errors, check if the URL is correct
# 2. Test connectivity using the "Test Connection" button in admin
# 3. For NGrok users: URL changes when NGrok restarts
# 4. Make sure your FastAPI server is running and accessible
# 5. 404 errors usually mean the endpoint path is wrong or server doesn't have the endpoint
